### MongoDB Installation on Ubuntu (from `.tgz`)

![ScreenShot Tool -20250104005845](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba9d91df-eb5e-4621-8ddf-d26fa717351a)

This guide will walk you through installing MongoDB on an Ubuntu system using the official `.tgz` package. It includes steps for setting up MongoDB, handling permissions, troubleshooting, and using `mongosh` for database interactions.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 20.04 or later.
- A user account with sudo privileges.
- A terminal or command-line access.

## Check Compatibility

Before proceeding, make sure your system is compatible with the MongoDB version you're going to install. Check your Ubuntu version using:

```bash
lsb_release -a
```
- `MongoDB` requires a compatible version of Ubuntu. Make sure to download the .tgz package that corresponds to your system's architecture and Ubuntu version.

You can check the official `MongoDB` download page for the latest community edition releases:
`MongoDB` Downloads

### Steps
 1. Download `MongoDB`
Ensure you have downloaded the `MongoDB` .tgz archive (e.g., mongodb-linux-x86_64-ubuntu2404-8.0.4.tgz) to your Downloads directory or any other folder. You can download it directly from the `MongoDB` Download Center.

2. Install Dependencies
Before extracting and setting up `MongoDB`, you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y libcurl4 openssl
```
3. Extract the MongoDB Archive
- Next, extract the downloaded .tgz file:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
tar -xvzf mongodb-linux-x86_64-ubuntu2404-8.0.4.tgz
```
- This will extract the MongoDB files into a directory named mongodb-linux-x86_64-ubuntu2404-8.0.4.

4. Move MongoDB Files to /opt Directory
- Move the extracted MongoDB files to the /opt directory for better organization:

```bash
sudo mv mongodb-linux-x86_64-ubuntu2404-8.0.4 /opt/mongodb
```
5. Set Up MongoDB Directories
- Create the necessary directories for MongoDBâ€™s data storage and logs:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /data/db
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/mongodb
```
6. Adjust Permissions
- Ensure that MongoDB has the proper permissions to read/write in the directories:

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) /data/db
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) /var/log/mongodb
```

Certainly! Here's how you can add the URL for checking MongoDB access:

7. Start MongoDB
- Now, you can start the MongoDB server. Use the following command to start MongoDB:

```bash
mongod --dbpath /data/db --logpath /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log
```
- Once MongoDB is running, you can verify if it's accessible by navigating to the following URL in your web browser:

`http://127.0.0.1:27017/`

#### Note: If you see the message:

```sql
It looks like you are trying to access MongoDB over HTTP on the native driver port.
```
- It means MongoDB is running, but the web interface isn't enabled. This is expected, as MongoDB doesn't expose an HTTP interface by default. You should interact with it using the Mongo shell (mongosh) or through a MongoDB client.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /data/db/journal
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) /data/db/journal
```
8. Verify MongoDB is Running
- Check if MongoDB is running:

```bash
ps aux | grep mongod
```
- You should see the mongod process running.

9. Access MongoDB with mongosh
- Now that MongoDB is running, you can interact with it using the Mongo shell:

```bash
mongosh
```
- This will connect you to the running MongoDB instance. You can now perform database operations.

Note: If you only have the old mongo shell installed, you can install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install mongodb-clients
```
10. Configure MongoDB (Optional)
- You may want to configure MongoDB to run automatically on startup or adjust other settings. For security, enabling authentication and access control is recommended for production environments.

### Enabling Authentication:
- To enable authentication, add the --auth option when starting MongoDB:

```bash
mongod --auth --dbpath /data/db --logpath /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log
```
#### Remote Access:
- If you want to allow remote access, bind MongoDB to all interfaces:

```bash
mongod --bind_ip_all --dbpath /data/db --logpath /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log
```
Alternatively, you can specify a particular IP address for remote access.

12. Stop MongoDB Server
- If you want to stop the MongoDB server, you can do so in a few different ways:

#### Using mongod Process ID (PID)
- You can stop MongoDB by finding its process ID (PID) and killing the process:

```bash
ps aux | grep mongod
```
- This will show you the mongod process and its PID. Once you have the PID, you can stop the server with:

```bash
sudo kill <PID>
```
- Replace <PID> with the actual process ID of the mongod process.

12. Using systemctl (If MongoDB is configured as a service)
- If MongoDB is set up as a system service, you can stop it using the systemctl command:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop mongod
```
3. Using Ctrl + C (If Running in Foreground)
- If MongoDB is running in the foreground (i.e., you started it manually in the terminal), you can stop it by pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal window where the mongod process is running.

13. Using mongosh to Insert Data
- Once MongoDB is running and you've accessed it through mongosh, you can begin performing database operations such as inserting data.


#### Steps: 
1. Start mongosh and Connect to MongoDB
To access MongoDB, open a new terminal window and run:

```bash
mongosh
```
- This will connect you to the MongoDB instance running locally.

2. Create or Switch to a Database
- To create a new database (or switch to an existing one), use the following command:

```bash
use myDatabase
```
- Replace myDatabase with your preferred database name. If the database doesn't exist, MongoDB will create it once you insert data into it.

3. Insert Data into a Collection
- To insert data, you'll need to specify a collection within your database. MongoDB collections are analogous to tables in relational databases.

#### Here's an example of how to insert a single document into a collection named users:

```bash
db.users.insertOne({
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "johndoe@example.com",
  age: 30
})
```
- This will insert a document with the specified fields (name, email, and age) into the users collection in the myDatabase database.

4. Insert Multiple Documents
- You can also insert multiple documents at once using insertMany:

```bash
db.users.insertMany([
  { name: "Jane Smith", email: "janesmith@example.com", age: 25 },
  { name: "Mark Johnson", email: "markj@example.com", age: 40 }
])
```
- This will insert two documents into the users collection.

5. Verify the Data Was Inserted
To verify that the data has been inserted, you can query the collection:

```bash
db.users.find()
```
This will display all the documents in the users collection.
